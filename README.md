This project is using [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) (ESP-IDF) and has been tested on ESP-WROOM-32 module and esp-idf `v3.2`.

An overview of the full project (i.e. ESP32 firmware, server and GUI) can be found [here](https://j4nn0.github.io/doc/ets_presentation.pdf).

This firmware is written with the purpose to sniff Probe Request packets sent by smartphones that are looking for Wi-Fi connection. When the Wi-Fi connection is active on a smartphone, it will send in broadcast (in all channels frequencies) a probe request messagge asking if there are any free Wi-Fi or some known ones (i.e. the smartphone knows the password for that Wi-Fi). The ESP32 will sniff it and extract different types of information.

The following information is taken from each sniffed packet:

- MAC of the smartphone that has sent the request
- SSID of the wifi to which the request is sent
- The Timestamp of when the request was sent
- Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
- Sequence Number (SN)
- HT Capabilities Info

After each minute these informations are sent to a [server](https://github.com/ETS-PoliTO/ETS-Server) and processed. Finally, it is possible to see the processed informations (smartphones real time location, smartphone frequency, etc.) through a [GUI](https://github.com/ETS-PoliTO/GUI-Application).

# Firmware Overview

The firmware consits in two main threads/tasks:

- Sniffer Task
    
    - Sniff Probe Request packet and save infomation described above into a file.

- Wi-Fi Task

    - Each minute, take the information saved by the **Sniffer Task** and send it to the server.
    - A `lock` is used in order to manage critical section for I/O operations in the file.

The ESP32 is configured in `WIFI_MODE_APSTA` mode: i.e. it creates "*soft-AP and station control block*" and starts "*soft-AP and station*". Thanks to this, the ESP32 is able to sniff and send informations to the server at the same time avoiding to lose packets information while sending data.

Here is the full list of information fields that can be in a Probe Request (source IEEE 802.11-2012):

And here below a packet sniffed with Wireshark in which you can see, for each field, the number of bits and their position within the packet:

# ESP-IDF Environment Configuration

This section might be outdated, checkout the [official site](https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for more info and for the latest guide on how to get started with ESP-IDF.

1. Setup Toolchain

	- [Windows](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/windows-setup.html)
	- [Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/linux-setup.html)
	- [Mac OS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/macos-setup.html)
	
2. Get ESP-IDF

	Besides the toolchain (that contains programs to compile and build the application), you also need ESP32 specific API / libraries.

	   cd ~/esp
	   git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
		
3. Checkout to version `v3.x`

	   cd esp-idf
	   git checkout release/v3.2
		
4. Setup path to ESP-IDF

	The toolchain programs access ESP-IDF using `IDF_PATH` environment variable.
	This variable should be set up on your PC, otherwise projects will not build.
	
	- [Windows](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/add-idf_path-to-profile.html#add-idf-path-to-profile-windows)
	- [Linux & Mac OS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/add-idf_path-to-profile.html#add-idf-path-to-profile-linux-macos)
	
5. Install the Required Python Packages

	   python -m pip install --user -r $IDF_PATH/requirements.txt

# Usage
	
1. Make sure you have exported the path
	
	   export IDF_PATH=~/esp/esp-idf
	   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin

2. Clone the repo
	
	   git clone https://github.com/ETS-PoliTO/esp32-sniffer.git

3. Establish serial connection between ESP32 and your PC
	
	   make menuconfig

	 Go to `Serial flasher config`, then `Default serial port` and set the port in which ESP32 is connected
	 
	 Note that, if you are using a bridge, probably you need to download some driver:
	 
	 - [CP210x](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
	 - [FTDI](https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)
	 
	 [This](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html) provides a  guide on how establish serial connection between ESP32 and PC. 

4. Build code and flash the ESP32

	   make all && make flash

5. See logs

	   make monitor

# File Configuration

The file `/main/Kconfig.projbuild` contains two different menu:

- SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System)

	It contains some important information about the SPIFFS partion:
	
	- SPIFFS Base address
	- SPIFFS Size
	- SPIFFS Logical block size
	- SPIFFS Logical page size
	
	[SPIFFS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/storage/spiffs.html) is a file system that supports wear leveling, file system consistency checks and more.

- Configurations

	It contains different variables, e.g.:

	- `ESP32_ID`: ID of the ESP32
	- `WIFI_SSID`: SSID of WiFi (network name)
	- `WIFI_PASS`: WiFi password (WPA or WPA2)
	- `BROKER_ADDR`: IP of the MQTT broker
	- `BROKER_PSW`: password of the MQTT broker
	- `BROKER_PORT`: port of the MQTT broker
	- `CHANNEL`: channel in which ESP32 will sniff PROBE REQUEST
	- `SNIFFING_TIME`: time of sniffing
	- etc...

### Variables configuration

In order to configure the variables mentioned above, open your terminal within the project folder and run:
	
    make menuconfig 
	
1. Select the menu you want to modify
2. Edit variables as you like

### Add customised Menu

You can also add different menus with different variables:

1. Open `Kconfig.projbuild`.
2. Start menu with: *menu <$yourMenuName>*.
3. Add the variables you need.
4. End menu with: *endmenu*.

# Components

- SPIFFS

	You need to create a [partition table](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/partition-tables.html).
